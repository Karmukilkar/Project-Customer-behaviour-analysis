# **Data Insertion and Analysis Using Python and MySQL**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to interact with a MySQL database for data insertion and analysis. Using the **mysql-connector-python** library, a connection was established between Python and MySQL, with a **cursor** object created to execute SQL queries for inserting data into the database.

After successfully inserting the data, **Pandas** was leveraged to analyze the dataset, handle null values, and clean the data to ensure accuracy. The analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior, product preferences, and sales trends.

## **Tech Stack Used**
- **Python**
- **MySQL**
- **mysql-connector-python** (for database connection)
- **Pandas** (for data analysis and handling null values)

## **Key Features**
- Establishing a connection between MySQL and Python
- Executing SQL queries to insert data into MySQL
- Using Pandas to clean and analyze data
- Handling missing values efficiently
- Extracting insights to improve business strategies

## **Final Analysis & Business Impact**
The insights derived from this project can be utilized to enhance the **ShopEasy** website, improving both user experience and customer retention. By understanding customer preferences and identifying gaps in the product catalog, targeted marketing strategies can be implemented to attract new users while enhancing the shopping experience for existing customers. This data-driven approach can significantly contribute to increasing **ShopEasy's** customer base and overall growth.
